# Entropy Beacon Example Contract

This contract is an example of a contract that uses the [Entropy Beacon](https://entropiclabs.io/beacon/) to utilize randomness on the blockchain. The contract requests entropy, and then will return a "heads" or "tails" attribute based on whether the entropy is even or odd. This output can be seen in the transaction logs for the contract execution.

For more, see the [Entropy Beacon documentation](https://entropiclabs.io/beacon/docs).
